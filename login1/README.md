# Login Pages Repository

This repository contains a growing collection of **custom-designed login and registration page templates**. Each page is built with clean HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript or Bootstrap. These are perfect for practice, portfolio inclusion, or adapting into real-world projects.

Each folder under the root contains a **standalone login UI**, complete with its own styles and layout logic.
